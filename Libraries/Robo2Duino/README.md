# Robo2Duino
Robo2Duino is a matrix based library to operate with Transformation matrix for robots with Arduino.

Robo2Duino is a generic library useful for Advanced Robotics Applications.

This library is part of a educational course to learn C++ with Arduino in practice with https://github.com/blascarr/Robo2Duino Course or http://www.blascarr.com/ webpage.

This Library gives some helpful methods to manipulate transformation Matrix in order to create references, planar space manipulation in 2D.

With Robo2Duino we can integrate different methods based on Matrix with <b>BasicLinearAlgebra</b> library.
